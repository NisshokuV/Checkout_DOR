# Checkout Project

This project implements a checkout process for an online store using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks. The checkout process consists of four main stages:

1. **Shopping Cart**: Displays the items the user intends to purchase, allowing them to adjust quantities, deselect items, and remove products from the cart. It also calculates the total cost, including subtotals and taxes.

2. **Customer Data**: Collects necessary information from the customer, including personal details, shipping address, billing information, and contact details. The user can specify if billing and shipping addresses are the same.

3. **Discounts and Payment Methods**: Allows users to enter discount codes and choose from various payment methods, including credit card, PayPal, and bank transfer. The system validates the input and updates the total cost accordingly.

4. **Confirmation of Purchase**: Provides a summary of the order, allowing users to review their information and make edits if necessary before finalizing the purchase.
